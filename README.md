# Employee-Tracker

My Employee Tracker project

This project required me to create an employee tracker which has been successful.

My motivation ws that I want to be a highly sought after full stack software developer.

I built this project to test my skills in sql and determine how much I need to improve.

The problem that building this project solved was reiterating tat although I understand sql alot tI still need to improve my skills.

I learned that I still have a lot to learn in relation to software development but if I perservere then I will succeed.

In order to view this project I had to run psuedo code and then ecact what the psuedo code statres. Then I only had to create the databses and tables and place the information inside of them.

In order to utilize this project you must run the mysql and view the databases and tables. Nothing follows.
